  * Fix ordering if include dirs
    There has been a long standind bug where INCLUDE_DIRS /usr/include is
    included twice.  The more important problem is it is before the
    /usr/local/include. This commit fixes the ordering. So now
    /usr/local/include comes before /usr/include, which it should, but
    this is a change in behaviour.

make-dfsg (4.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Number signs (#) appearing inside a macro reference or function invocation
    no longer introduce comments and should not be escaped with backslashes:
    thus a call such as:
      foo := $(shell echo '#')
    is legal.  Previously the number sign needed to be escaped, for example:
      foo := $(shell echo '\#')
    Now this latter will resolve to "\#".  If you want to write makefiles
    portable to both versions, assign the number sign to a variable:
      H := \#
      foo := $(shell echo '$H')
    This was claimed to be fixed in 3.81, but wasn't, for some reason.
    To detect this change search for 'nocomment' in the .FEATURES variable.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Previously appending using '+=' to an empty variable would result in a value
    starting with a space.  Now the initial space is only added if the variable
    already contains some value.  Similarly, appending an empty string does not
    add a trailing space.
  * NOTE: Deprecated behavior.
    Contrary to the documentation, suffix rules with prerequisites are being
    treated BOTH as simple targets AND as pattern rules.  Further, the
    prerequisites are ignored by the pattern rules.  POSIX specifies that in
    order to be a suffix rule there can be no prerequisites defined.  In this
    release if POSIX mode is enabled then rules with prerequisites cannot be
    suffix rules.  If POSIX mode is not enabled then the previous behavior is
    preserved (a pattern rule with no extra prerequisites is created) AND a
    warning about this behavior is generated:
      warning: ignoring prerequisites on suffix rule definition
    The POSIX behavior will be adopted as the only behavior in a future release
    of GNU make so please resolve any warnings.

make-dfsg (4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!

  The ar program in the binutils package in Debian is now configured
  with --enable-deterministic-archives. This change makes the archives
  reproducible, by setting the UID, GID, and timestamp to 0. However,
  when dealing with archives created with the libxx(*.o) style rules,
  make needs the timestamp of the file in order to decide to update it
  or not. With the current deterministic behavior of ar, the time stamp
  is always 0. This has consequences, since make will fall back to always
  adding each member to the archive, whether or not it is required. This
  is a change in behaviour, and, for instance, it makes make fail to
  build, failing 7 out of 10 archive tests.
  .
  Since binutils will create archive with time stamps set to 0 when
  running in "deterministic" mode, make will always try to update such
  members. When this is detected, make will emit a warning.
  .
  There is some online discussion:

make-dfsg (4.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
  If .POSIX is specified, then make adheres to the POSIX backslash/newline
  handling requirements, which introduces the following changes to the
  standard backslash/newline handling in non-recipe lines:
  * Any trailing space before the backslash is preserved
  * Each backslash/newline (plus subsequent whitespace) is converted to a
    single space

make-dfsg (3.82-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. A complete list of bugs fixed in this version is
    available here:  http://sv.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?group=make&report_id=111&fix_release_id=104&set=custom
  * WARNING: Future backward-incompatibility!
    Wildcards are not documented as returning sorted values, but up to and
    including this release the results have been sorted and some makefiles
    are apparently depending on that.  In the next release of GNU make,
    for performance reasons, we may remove that sorting.  If your
    makefiles require sorted results from wildcard expansions, use the
    $(sort ...)  function to request it explicitly.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    The POSIX standard for make was changed in the 2008 version in a
    fundamentally incompatible way: make is required to invoke the shell
    as if the '-e' flag were provided.  Because this would break many
    makefiles that have been written to conform to the original text of
    the standard, the default behavior of GNU make remains to invoke the
    shell with simply '-c'.  However, any makefile specifying the .POSIX
    special target will follow the new POSIX standard and pass '-e' to the
    shell.  See also .SHELLFLAGS below.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    The '$?' variable now contains all prerequisites that caused the
    target to be considered out of date, even if they do not exist
    (previously only existing targets were provided in $?).
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    As a result of parser enhancements, three backward-compatibility
    issues exist: first, a prerequisite containing an "=" cannot be
    escaped with a backslash any longer.  You must create a variable
    containing an "=" and use that variable in the prerequisite.  Second,
    variable names can no longer contain whitespace, unless you put the
    whitespace in a variable and use the variable.  Third, in previous
    versions of make it was sometimes not flagged as an error for explicit
    and pattern targets to appear in the same rule.  Now this is always
    reported as an error.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    The pattern-specific variables and pattern rules are now applied in
    the shortest stem first order instead of the definition order
    (variables and rules with the same stem length are still applied in
    the definition order). This produces the usually-desired behavior
    where more specific patterns are preferred. To detect this feature
    search for 'shortest-stem' in the .FEATURES special variable.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    The library search behavior has changed to be compatible with the
    standard linker behavior. Prior to this version for prerequisites
    specified using the -lfoo syntax make first searched for libfoo.so in
    the current directory, vpath directories, and system directories. If
    that didn't yield a match, make then searched for libfoo.a in these
    directories. Starting with this version make searches first for
    libfoo.so and then for libfoo.a in each of these directories in order.

make (3.80+3.81.b3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility! (this may help CDBS users)
    GNU make now implements a generic "second expansion" feature on the
    prerequisites of both explicit and implicit (pattern) rules.  In order
    to enable this feature, the special target '.SECONDEXPANSION' must be
    defined before the first target which takes advantage of it.  If this
    feature is enabled then after all rules have been parsed the
    prerequisites are expanded again, this time with all the automatic
    variables in scope.  This means that in addition to using standard
    SysV $$@ in prerequisites lists, you can also use complex functions
    such as $$(notdir $$@) etc.  This behavior applies to implicit rules,
    as well, where the second expansion occurs when the rule is matched.
    However, this means that you need to double-quote any "$" in your
    filenames; instead of "foo: boo$$bar" you now must write "foo:
    foo$$$$bar".  Note that the SysV $$@ etc. feature, which used to be
    available by default, is now ONLY available when the .SECONDEXPANSION
    target is defined.  If your makefiles take advantage of this SysV
    feature you will need to update them.
  * New special variables available in this release:
    - .INCLUDE_DIRS: Expands to a list of directories that make searches
      for included makefiles.
  * New functions available in this release:
    - $(info ...) prints its arguments to stdout.  No makefile name or
      line number info, etc. is printed.
    - $(flavor ...) returns the flavor of a variable.

make (3.80+3.81.b3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    GNU make now implements a generic "second expansion" feature on the
    prerequisites of both explicit and implicit (pattern) rules.  After
    all rules have been parsed the prerequisites are expanded again, this
    time with all the automatic variables in scope.  This means that in

    double-quote any "$" in your filenames; instead of "foo: boo$$bar" you
    now must write "foo: foo$$$$bar".
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    In order to comply with POSIX, the way in which GNU make processes
    backslash-newline sequences in command strings has changed.  See the
    GNU make manual section "Command Execution" for details.
  * New command-line option: -L (--check-symlink-times).  On systems that
    support symbolic links, if this option is given then GNU make will use
    the most recent modification time of any symbolic links that are used
    to resolve target files.  The default behavior remains as it always
    has: use the modification time of the actual target file only.
  * The "else" conditional line can now be followed by any other legal
    conditional on the same line: this does not increase the depth of the
    conditional nesting, so only one "endif" is required to close the
    conditional.
  * All pattern-specific variables that match a given target are now used
    (previously only the first match was used).
  * Target-specific variables can be marked as exportable using the
    "export" keyword.
  * In a recursive $(call ...) context, any extra arguments from the outer
    call are now masked in the context of the inner call.
  * Implemented a solution for the "thundering herd" problem with "-j -l".
    This version of GNU make uses an algorithm suggested by Thomas Riedl
    <thomas.riedl@siemens.com> to track the number of jobs started in the
    last second and artificially adjust GNU make's view of the system's
    load average accordingly.
  * New special variables available in this release:
     - .FEATURES: Contains a list of special features available in this
       version of GNU make.
     - .DEFAULT_GOAL: Set the name of the default goal make will
       use if no goals are provided on the command line.
     - MAKE_RESTARTS: If set, then this is the number of times this
       instance of make has been restarted (see "How Makefiles Are Remade"
       in the manual).
     - New automatic variable: $| (added in 3.80, actually): contains all
       the order-only prerequisites defined for the target.
  * New functions available in this release:
     - $(lastword ...) returns the last word in the list.  This gives
       identical results as $(word $(words ...) ...), but is much faster.
     - $(abspath ...) returns the absolute path (all "." and ".."
       directories resolved, and any duplicate "/" characters removed) for
       each path provided.
     - $(realpath ...) returns the canonical pathname for each path
       provided.  The canonical pathname is the absolute pathname, with
       all symbolic links resolved as well.
     - $(info ...) prints informative messages to stdout.  No makefile
       name or line number info, etc. is printed, just the message.
  * Changes made for POSIX compatibility:
     - Only touch targets (under -t) if they have at least one command.
     - Setting the SHELL make variable does NOT change the value of the
       SHELL environment variable given to programs invoked by make.  As
       an enhancement to POSIX, if you export the make variable SHELL then
       it will be set in the environment, just as before.
